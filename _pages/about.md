I'm a Master's in Computer Science student at Drexel University. Currently, I am working with [Dr. Shadi Rezapour](https://www.shadirezapour.com/research-team), focusing on substance use disorders (SUD) discourse on social media. My research interests are in the intersection of computational social science and natural language processing, with a focus on analyzing linguistic variations and embedded social meanings on social media platforms. I received my B.A. in Computer Science from Grinnell College in 2023. When I am not coding, I will most likely be playing ultimate frisbee or watching Eagles games.
