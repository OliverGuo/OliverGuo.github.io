I'm a Master's in Computer Science student at [Drexel University](https://drexel.edu/cci/). Currently, I am working with [Dr. Shadi Rezapour](https://www.shadirezapour.com/about), focusing on substance use disorders (SUD) discourse on social media. My research interests are in the intersection of computational social science and natural language processing, with a focus on analyzing linguistic variations and embedded social meanings on social media platforms. I received my B.A. in Computer Science from [Grinnell College](https://www.grinnell.edu/) in 2023. When I am not coding, I will most likely be playing [ultimate frisbee](https://philadelphia.leaguelab.com/team/793221/Flying-Discs) or watching [Eagles games](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1iltvxj/highlight_cooper_dejean_picksix_on_his_birthday/).
