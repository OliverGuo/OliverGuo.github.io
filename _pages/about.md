I'm a Master's in Computer Science student at Drexel University. I received B.A. in Computer Science from Grinnell College in 2023. Currently, I am working with [Shadi Rezapour](https://www.shadirezapour.com/research-team), focusing on substance use disorders (SUD) discourse on social media. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee and watching Eagles game on Sundays.
